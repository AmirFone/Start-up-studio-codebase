# Startup Studio Repository

This repository contains the initial iterations of code for the Startup Studio class.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to track the progress and development of code throughout the Start of Studio class. It serves as a central location to store and manage different versions of the code as it evolves.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
	git clone https://github.com/your-username/start-of-studio.git

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
	cd start-of-studio

3. Explore the different iterations of the code stored in separate directories or branches.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
```
  start-of-studio/
  ├── iteration1/
  │   ├── main.py
  │   └── ...
  ├── iteration2/
  │   ├── main.py
  │   └── ...
  ├── iteration3/
